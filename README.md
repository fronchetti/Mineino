Playing Minecraft using an Arduino and Artificial Intelligence :roller_coaster:

In this project, we simulate keyboard keys and mouse interactions in our operating system to play Minecraft. The keyboard keys is responsible for moving our player and interacting with the block's world, it is done using instructions from an Arduino, while the mouse is simulated using a face recognition system, to move the player's in-game camera.
